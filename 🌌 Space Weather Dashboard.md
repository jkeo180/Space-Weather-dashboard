# 🌌 Space Weather Dashboard



###### A data-driven dashboard for monitoring space weather conditions and their potential impact on satellites, communications, and autonomous systems.

###### 

###### This project focuses on \*\*real-world data ingestion, processing, and visualization\*\*, with an eye toward \*\*space robotics, satellite operations, and mission awareness\*\*.

##### \## 🚀 Project Overview



Space weather—such as solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and radiation spikes—can disrupt satellites, GPS, power grids, and autonomous space systems.



This dashboard:



\* Collects and processes space weather data

\* Visualizes key indicators in a clear, actionable way

\* Lays the groundwork for \*\*automated alerts and decision-making systems\*\*



The long-term vision is to connect \*\*perception → analysis → response\*\*, similar to how autonomous spacecraft and ground systems operate.

##### \## 📊 Features



\* 📡 \*\*Live / historical space weather data\*\*

\* ☀️ Solar activity indicators (e.g. flares, radiation levels)

\* 🌍 Geomagnetic storm metrics (Kp, Dst where applicable)

\* 📈 Clean visualizations for trends and anomalies

\* 🧪 Modular design for future ML / alert integration

##### \## 🛠️ Tech Stack



\*\*Languages \& Tools\*\*



\* Python

\* NumPy

\* Pandas



\*\*Data \& APIs\*\*



\* Public space weather datasets (NASA / NOAA sources)

\* Dataset parsing and normalization pipelines



\*\*Visualization\*\*



\* Matplotlib / Plotly (or your choice)

\* Dashboard-ready structure (CLI or web-ready)



\*\*Optional / Planned\*\*

##### \## 🧠 Why This Project Matters



This is not a toy dashboard.



It demonstrates:



\* Working with \*\*real scientific datasets\*\*

\* Data cleaning and validation

\* Translating raw signals into \*\*operational insight\*\*

\* Systems thinking relevant to:



&nbsp; \* Space robotics

&nbsp; \* Satellite health monitoring

&nbsp; \* Autonomous decision support



These are the same principles used in \*\*mission operations and autonomous space systems\*\*.
